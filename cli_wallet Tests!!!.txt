============== 0. What is it and how it works:

These tests are intented for testing the functionality on MongoDB plugin in the testnet, but also could be using for another purposes i.e. testing main blockchain database.

You should run all the following tests ("Post+post", "post+delete" and etc.)
Before running each test you should:
- stop the golosd if running;
- remove blockchain folder;
- drop the Golos db;
- also it's recommended to drop wallet.json file;
- start the golosd: cd /programs/golosd, ./golosd (use 3rd terminal where you willn't call cli_wallet commands, because you cannot call some commands in terminal where golosd running)

TIP: Do not go to cli_wallets instantly after golosd started. It can cause errors in cli_wallets. Wait the few seconds.

============== 1. Post+post:

Have 1 terminal with running golosd daemin (cd build/programs/golosd, ./golosd)
Next open 2 terminals with cd to build/programs/cli_wallet.
TIP: if using SSH - also use VNC: 1st cli_wallet terminal will be in SSH, 2nd cli_wallet - in the VNC, golosd's terminal - in the VNC, too.

Run the 1st terminal and paste following, but don't run last command (paste without last newline), last command should wait Enter pressing:

./cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint=ws://127.0.0.1:8091
set_password qwer
unlock qwer
import_key 5JVFFWRLwz6JoP9kguuRFfytToGU6cLgBVTL9t6NB3D3BQLbUBS
create_account cyberfounder test "{}" "30.000 GOLOS" true
transfer_to_vesting cyberfounder test "30.000 GOLOS" true
post_comment  test test "" test hello world "{}" true

Run the 2nd terminal and paste following, also without last newline:

./cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint=ws://127.0.0.1:8091
set_password qwer
unlock qwer
import_key 5JVFFWRLwz6JoP9kguuRFfytToGU6cLgBVTL9t6NB3D3BQLbUBS
create_account cyberfounder test2 "{}" "30.000 GOLOS" true
transfer_to_vesting cyberfounder test2 "30.000 GOLOS" true
post_comment  test2 test "" test hello world "{}" true

Place 2 windows in such orders to fast press Enter in 1st + 2nd.
Wait for new block in golosd log.
And press 1st and 2nd!

Result: 2 comment_objects in the MongoDB. No errors in log.

============== 2. Post+delete.

Intended to check the deletion when post is not yet created.

1st:

./cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint=ws://127.0.0.1:8091
set_password qwer
unlock qwer
import_key 5JVFFWRLwz6JoP9kguuRFfytToGU6cLgBVTL9t6NB3D3BQLbUBS
create_account cyberfounder test "{}" "30.000 GOLOS" true
transfer_to_vesting cyberfounder test "30.000 GOLOS" true
post_comment  test test "" test hello world "{}" true

2nd:

begin_builder_transaction 
add_operation_to_builder_transaction 0 ["delete_comment", {"author":"test","permlink":"test"}]
sign_builder_transaction 0 true

Wait for new block in golosd log. And press 1st, 2nd!

Result: comment_object created, has "removed": true field, but hasn't all fields 

============== 3. Post+delete-waiting.

Run only 1 terminal for cli_wallet.

Paste following AND press Enter immediately:

./cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint=ws://127.0.0.1:8091
set_password qwer
unlock qwer
import_key 5JVFFWRLwz6JoP9kguuRFfytToGU6cLgBVTL9t6NB3D3BQLbUBS
create_account cyberfounder test "{}" "30.000 GOLOS" true
transfer_to_vesting cyberfounder test "30.000 GOLOS" true
post_comment  test test "" test hello world "{}" true

Wait until comment_object will appear in the MongoDB.

After it, paste AND execute:

begin_builder_transaction 
add_operation_to_builder_transaction 0 ["delete_comment", {"author":"test","permlink":"test"}]
sign_builder_transaction 0 true

Result: comment_object has all fields and the "removed" field.

============== 4. Post+vote, post+vote-waiting.

Same as post+delete, and post+delete-waiting, but instead of delete using following:

create_account cyberfounder testg "{}" "30.000 GOLOS" true
transfer_to_vesting cyberfounder testg "30.000 GOLOS" true
vote testg test test -10 true

Result: comment_vote_object; comment_object has "net_votes" field changed, "abs_rshares" field changed, etc.

TIP: if you using negative vote, i.e. -10 in example,  you can next test delete comment after 30-90 minutes.
If you uisng 10 you couldn't delete comment, but could also test rewards.

=============== 5. Vote+vote.

Same as post+post, but use 2 voting terminals (with different account names).

Result: 2 comment_vote_objects; comment_object has "net_votes" field changed according both, "abs_rshares" field changed according both, etc. 

=============== 6. Rewards.

Same as the Post+vote (with positive vote, i.e. 10 nor -10), but after comment vote wrote also call following:

publish_feed cyberfounder {"base": "1.000 GBG", "quote": "10.000 GOLOS"} true

And wait for 2 minutes (!!!you should firstly set this interval, see "_ golos - libraries - protocol.txt"!!!)
