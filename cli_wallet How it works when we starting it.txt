cli_wallet starts from "programs/cli_wallet/main.cpp"

Here is unsafe_main() method

Here is wallet_cli variable of type fc::rpc::cli which actually handles command line (after websocket client connected and etc.)

main.cpp's unsafe_main() creates the api:
fc:api<wallet_api> wapi(wapiptr);

Next, main.cpp's daemon_run() registers wapi with cli::register_api()

Next, main.cpp's daemon_run() calls:
cli::start(); cli::wait();

---

fc::rpc::cli is in "/golos/thirdparty/fc/src/rpc/cli.cpp", inherits fc::rpc::api_connection

Here is loop of handling commands in cli::run() method

On each command it calls receive_call(0, ...) method which is implemented in fc::rpc::api_connection class

receive_call(0, ...) actually calls generic_api::call(method_name, args), which is created on wapi (which is fc:api<wallet_api>, as above) by: new generic_api(wapi, ...)
 NOTE: generic_api is in api_connection.hpp
